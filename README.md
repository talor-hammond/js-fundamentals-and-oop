### Difference between `null` and `undefined`
* `undefined` means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value
* `null` is an assignment value: it can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value
* Also, `undefined` and `null` are two distinct types: `undefined` is a type itself, while `null` is an object.

e.g. looking up a property on an object which doesn't yet exist, or has not been assigned, will return `undefined`

Both are two of JavaScript's *falsy* values, & both are *primitive* values.
