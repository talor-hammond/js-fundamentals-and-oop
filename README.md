### Difference between `null` and `undefined`
* `undefined` means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value
* `null` is an assignment value: it can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value
Also, `undefined` and `null` are two distinct types: `undefined` is a type itself, while `null` is an object.
